# Dominant color async

Packagist release for this plugin has been removed since Packagist does not support compiled assets like JavaScript or CSS unless they are committed to the Git repository. Please download the latest release from [GitHub releases](https://github.com/CreunaFI/dominant-color-async/releases). Auto-updater is included in the plugin. If you need install the plugin using Composer, set up your own [SatisPress](https://github.com/cedaro/satispress) repository.
